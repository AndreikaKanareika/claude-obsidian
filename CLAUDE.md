# claude-obsidian — Claude + Obsidian Wiki Vault

This folder is both a Claude Code plugin and an Obsidian vault.

**Plugin name:** `claude-obsidian` (v1.7+ "Compound Vault" — see [docs/compound-vault-guide.md](docs/compound-vault-guide.md); v1.8+ adds methodology modes — see [docs/methodology-modes-guide.md](docs/methodology-modes-guide.md))
**Skills:** `/wiki`, `/wiki-ingest`, `/wiki-query`, `/wiki-lint`, `/wiki-cli` (v1.7), `/wiki-retrieve` (v1.7, opt-in), `/wiki-mode` (v1.8)
**Vault path:** This directory (open in Obsidian directly)

## What This Vault Is For

This vault demonstrates the LLM Wiki pattern — a persistent, compounding knowledge base for Claude + Obsidian. Drop any source, ask any question, and the wiki grows richer with every session.

## Vault Structure

```
.raw/           source documents — immutable, Claude reads but never modifies
wiki/           Claude-generated knowledge base
_templates/     Obsidian Templater templates
_attachments/   images and PDFs referenced by wiki pages
```

## How to Use

Drop a source file into `.raw/`, then tell Claude: "ingest [filename]".

Ask any question. Claude reads the index first, then drills into relevant pages.

Run `/wiki` to scaffold a new vault or check setup status.

Run "lint the wiki" every 10-15 ingests to catch orphans and gaps.

## Cross-Project Access

To reference this wiki from another Claude Code project, add to that project's CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Wiki Knowledge Base
My persistent knowledge base lives at the path in `$CLAUDE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT`
(or an absolute path like `~/path/to/vault`), reachable via the `obsidian-vault`
MCP tools (or by reading the files directly).

Before answering anything that isn't a self-contained coding task, consult it:
1. Read wiki/hot.md (recent-context cache)
2. Then wiki/index.md (master catalog)
3. Drill into the specific wiki pages that match, and cite them
If nothing relevant exists, say so and answer normally.

Skip the wiki for routine coding tasks unrelated to its topics, or things already in this project.

Write back too, don't just read: when a durable insight, decision, or answer emerges,
proactively offer to save it (/save) or ingest sources (/wiki-ingest) to the vault via the
obsidian-vault MCP tools (path-agnostic, so they work from any project). Reading is automatic
when CLAUDE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT is set in ~/.claude/settings.json — claude-obsidian
v1.9.2-global-access+ injects wiki/hot.md at session start from any directory.
```

To point this project at a **different** vault than the global default, use an absolute path in place of `$CLAUDE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT`. Platform caveat for auto-commit (`flock` on Windows) lives in [docs/updating-and-configuring.md](docs/updating-and-configuring.md).

**Command hooks cross-project (v1.9.2-global-access):** the `CLAUDE.md` pointer above covers *reading*. To make the plugin's command hooks (hot-cache injection, vault auto-commit, Stop-time refresh nudge) fire when Claude Code runs from *another* directory against a single global vault, set `CLAUDE_OBSIDIAN_VAULT` to the vault's absolute path in `~/.claude/settings.json`'s `env` block. Unset, hooks fall back to the current directory (pre-global-access behavior). The Stop hook also commits vault writes made via the `obsidian-vault` MCP server. See [docs/updating-and-configuring.md](docs/updating-and-configuring.md).

## Plugin Skills

| Skill | Trigger |
|-------|---------|
| `/wiki` | Setup, scaffold, route to sub-skills |
| `ingest [source]` | Single or batch source ingestion |
| `query: [question]` | Answer from wiki content |
| `lint the wiki` | Health check |
| `/save` | File the current conversation as a structured wiki note |
| `/autoresearch [topic]` | Autonomous research loop: search, fetch, synthesize, file |
| `/canvas` | Visual layer: add images, PDFs, notes to Obsidian canvas |
| `/wiki-cli` (v1.7) | Obsidian CLI transport wrapper; default mutation path on desktop |
| `/wiki-retrieve` (v1.7) | Hybrid contextual + BM25 + cosine-rerank retrieval (opt-in via `bash bin/setup-retrieve.sh`) |
| `/wiki-mode` (v1.8) | Methodology modes (LYT / PARA / Zettelkasten / Generic). Set via `bash bin/setup-mode.sh`; consumed by wiki-ingest / save / autoresearch for routing new pages |
| `/think` (v1.9) | The 10-principle thinking loop (OBSERVE-OBSERVE-LISTEN-THINK-CONNECT-CONNECT-FEEL-ACCEPT-CREATE-GROW) as an invocable workflow. Apply to architectural decisions, audits, post-mortems, ambiguous user requests. Every other skill has a "How to think" appendix mapping this framework to its specific work |

## Transport (v1.7+)

`scripts/detect-transport.sh` writes `.vault-meta/transport.json` on first run and refreshes weekly. Skills consult it before mutating the vault. Fallback chain: Obsidian CLI → mcp-obsidian → mcpvault → filesystem (always-available floor). Decision tree: [wiki/references/transport-fallback.md](wiki/references/transport-fallback.md).

## Concurrency (v1.7+)

`scripts/wiki-lock.sh` provides per-file advisory locks for safe multi-writer ingest. Every wiki page write should be guarded by `wiki-lock acquire`/`release`. Stale-after default is 60s; cross-process release allowed by design. Auto-commit (`scripts/auto-commit.sh`, shared by the PostToolUse and Stop hooks since the global-access release) defers `git add` while locks are held. Closes the latent multi-writer corruption hole from v1.6.

## Methodology Modes (v1.8+)

Pick an organizational style for the vault via `bash bin/setup-mode.sh`. Four modes available: **generic** (v1.7 default — no opinion), **LYT** (Linking Your Thinking — MOCs + atomic notes), **PARA** (Projects/Areas/Resources/Archives), **Zettelkasten** (timestamped IDs, flat, dense linking). The mode is written to `.vault-meta/mode.json` (gitignored by default; `git add -f` to commit). `wiki-ingest`, `save`, and `autoresearch` consult `python3 scripts/wiki-mode.py route <type> "<name>"` before filing new pages — no special-casing needed in the consumer skills. Full guide: [docs/methodology-modes-guide.md](docs/methodology-modes-guide.md). Closes priority gap 5 from the May 2026 compass artifact.

## Pre-commit verifier (v1.7.1+)

After staging changes for a non-trivial workstream but BEFORE running `git commit`, dispatch the `verifier` agent (`agents/verifier.md`). It reads `git diff --cached`, applies the /best-practices six-cut + agent kernel, and returns findings in four tiers (BLOCKER / HIGH / MEDIUM / LOW) with file:line citations. The agent has read-only tools (Read, Grep, Glob, Bash) — it can inspect but never modify, so its output is purely advisory. This closes the loop the v1.7 audit revealed: code went worker → commit with no separate verifier pass, which is how BLOCKER B1 (data-egress consent gap) slipped through. See `docs/audits/v1.7.0-audit-2026-05-17.md` §10 for the retrospective.

## MCP (Optional)

If you configured the MCP server, Claude can read and write vault notes directly.
See `skills/wiki/references/mcp-setup.md` for setup instructions.

## Release Blog Post

After cutting a new release (git tag + `gh release create`), run:

```
/release-blog
```

This generates a blog post on https://agricidaniel.com/blog/, handles cover image generation, SEO metadata, FAQ schema, internal linking, sitemap/llms.txt updates, Vercel deployment, and Google indexing.
